To create an app that accepts a sample dataset (e.g., from Athena or Snowflake), generates a schema, and produces a data contract, you can break down the task into key steps as follows:

### 1. **App Setup (Ruby on Rails)**
   - **Use Rails:** Set up a Rails app with the necessary controllers, models, and views to handle file uploads or API requests containing the dataset.
   - **Gems to Install:**
     - `pg` or `mysql2` for connecting to PostgreSQL or MySQL databases.
     - `aws-sdk-s3` if you plan to handle large datasets from cloud storage like S3.
     - `json-schema` gem to validate schema definitions and contracts.

### 2. **Accepting the Dataset Sample**
   You'll need to allow users to upload a sample of the dataset (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.), or allow connections to query from external services like Athena or Snowflake.
   
   - **File Upload (CSV/JSON/Parquet):** You can use Rails' file upload capabilities (using ActiveStorage) to upload and parse datasets.
   - **Connect to Athena/Snowflake:**
     - For Athena, use the AWS SDK (`aws-sdk-athena`) to run queries.
     - For Snowflake, use the `snowflake-connector-ruby` gem.
     
   Example of parsing a CSV file in Ruby:
   ```ruby
   require 'csv'

   def parse_csv(file)
     rows = []
     CSV.foreach(file.path, headers: true) do |row|
       rows << row.to_hash
     end
     rows
   end
   ```

### 3. **Generating the Schema**
   Once the sample is provided, you need to analyze it and infer the schema based on the data types, column names, and other characteristics.

   #### Infer Schema from Sample Dataset:
   - For each column in the sample dataset, infer the data type (e.g., `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `date`, etc.).
   - Handle nullability, default values, and constraints if they can be derived.
   - You could use libraries like `activerecord-import` for bulk imports and schema analysis, or custom logic to detect types.

   Example of schema generation based on sample data:
   ```ruby
   def generate_schema_from_sample(rows)
     schema = {}
     first_row = rows.first

     first_row.each do |column, value|
       schema[column] = infer_data_type(value)
     end

     schema
   end

   def infer_data_type(value)
     case value
     when /^\d+$/ then :integer
     when /^\d+\.\d+$/ then :float
     when /^[Tt]rue|[Ff]alse$/ then :boolean
     when /\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/ then :date
     else
       :string
     end
   end
   ```

   #### Sample Schema Example (JSON):
   ```json
   {
     "id": { "type": "integer", "nullable": false },
     "name": { "type": "string", "nullable": true },
     "price": { "type": "float", "nullable": false }
   }
   ```

### 4. **Generating a Data Contract**
   A **data contract** is an agreement between systems or teams on the structure, format, and rules of data exchanges. It defines what data should look like, its constraints, and what schema violations are allowed or prevented.

   Your app should generate a contract that:
   - **Describes the schema** (as inferred from the dataset).
   - **Includes constraints** such as allowed data types, nullability, and expected value ranges (if any).
   - **Specifies breaking rules**â€”what changes would break the contract.

   Example of a data contract:
   ```json
   {
     "table_name": "products",
     "columns": [
       { "name": "id", "type": "integer", "nullable": false },
       { "name": "name", "type": "string", "nullable": true },
       { "name": "price", "type": "float", "nullable": false }
     ],
     "rules": {
       "strict_nullability": true,
       "type_must_match": true,
       "column_additions_allowed": true,
       "column_removals_allowed": false
     }
   }
   ```

   - **Strict Nullability:** If `true`, columns marked as non-nullable must never have null values.
   - **Type Must Match:** If `true`, any data type changes would be considered schema-breaking.
   - **Column Additions/Removals:** These flags allow or prevent schema changes that add or remove columns.

### 5. **Validating Data Against the Data Contract**
   Once the schema and data contract are generated, you can validate future data against the contract:
   - **Check for Schema Violations:** Compare the new schema or dataset against the contract.
   - **Validate Data Types:** Ensure data adheres to the expected data types and constraints.
   - **Contract Validation Logic:**
   
   ```ruby
   def validate_against_contract(contract, new_schema)
     contract_columns = contract["columns"]
     new_schema_columns = new_schema.keys

     # Check for column removal violations
     if !contract["rules"]["column_removals_allowed"] && (contract_columns.map { |col| col["name"] } - new_schema_columns).any?
       return "Schema-breaking: Column(s) removed"
     end

     # Check for data type changes
     contract_columns.each do |column|
       expected_type = column["type"]
       actual_type = new_schema[column["name"]]

       if contract["rules"]["type_must_match"] && expected_type != actual_type
         return "Schema-breaking: Column #{column['name']} type mismatch. Expected #{expected_type}, got #{actual_type}"
       end
     end

     "No schema-breaking changes detected."
   end
   ```

### 6. **App Flow**
   - **User uploads dataset** (CSV, JSON, etc.), or the app fetches the dataset from Athena/Snowflake.
   - **App infers schema** from the dataset sample.
   - **App generates data contract** based on the inferred schema.
   - **Schema and contract are saved** and made available via the UI or API.
   - **Future data uploads are validated** against the contract, and schema-breaking changes are reported.

### 7. **API or Web Interface**
   - **Web UI (Rails):** Use Rails views to allow users to upload samples, view generated schemas, and data contracts.
   - **API:** Create an API endpoint where users can submit datasets and retrieve schema or contract results.

   Example API controller:
   ```ruby
   class SchemaController < ApplicationController
     def generate_schema
       dataset = params[:dataset] # assuming dataset comes from request
       parsed_data = parse_csv(dataset) # or another method to parse

       schema = generate_schema_from_sample(parsed_data)
       contract = generate_contract_from_schema(schema)

       render json: { schema: schema, contract: contract }
     end
   end
   ```

### 8. **Optional: Schema Versioning**
   - Keep track of schema versions for each dataset.
   - Allow for comparison between versions to track changes over time.

This approach provides a flexible way to work with different datasets and services (Athena/Snowflake) and ensures that your app can generate both schemas and data contracts automatically. Would you like help with implementing any specific part of this process?
